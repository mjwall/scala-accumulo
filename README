Scala-Accumulo
==============

This is a work in progress, making a Scala wrapper for Accumulo.  Beside providing convience methods for working with Accumulo, the intent is to return Scala collections from a query.

Although most of the Scala world uses SBT, I am attempting to do this with Maven.  I would imagine that most of the people using Accumulo are comfortable with Maven and I fear using SBT would hinder any possible use.

Lots more to be done here, but it is a start.

Example usage
-------------

Here is what I am trying to do

val a = Accumulo()
val test1 = a.createTable("test1") or a.table("test1")
test1.write("a","b","c","d")
test1.write("e","f","g","h")
val rows = test1.scan
row.map(_.getRowId) // Seq("a","e")
a.deleteTable(test1) or a.deleteTable("test1")
